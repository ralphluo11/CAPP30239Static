# {Democracy and its Origin}

{Jiahang Luo}

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?

My current goal is to visualize how institutional quality and democratic indicators relate to economic performance and resilience using the V-Dem dataset and complementary World Bank data. This goal remains consistent with my original proposal, but I refined the variable selection: some factors like education were dropped due to extensive missing data in developing countries. The project now focuses on consistently available indicators—such as rule of law, equality, and freedom of expression—to ensure comparability across countries while still highlighting global and regional patterns of democratic resilience.

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?

Yes, I am facing several data challenges. The main issue is the large size of the V-Dem dataset—when processing the full country-year panel, the notebook often hits the maximum row display limit, and some operations take up to 10 minutes to run without producing results. I also encounter difficulties handling outliers that distort visual scales and regression patterns, especially for smaller or conflict-affected countries. Despite these challenges, I am using only real data from V-Dem and the World Bank, not mock data.
